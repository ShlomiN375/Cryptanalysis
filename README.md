# Cryptanalysis recopilation

This is a big recopilation of cryptanalisis tools/books/papers and crypto challenges/solutions. I'm planning to update it periodically. If you know some good information in this direction please ping me ;)

A tool to analyze multi-byte xor cipher
https://github.com/hellman/xortool

YAFU (with assistance from other free software) uses the most powerful modern algorithms (and implementations of them) to factor input integers in a completely automated way. The automation within YAFU is state-of-the-art, combining factorization algorithms in an intelligent and adaptive methodology that minimizes the time to find the factors of arbitrary input integers. Most algorithm implementations are multi-threaded, allowing YAFU to fully utilize multi- or many-core processors (including SNFS, GNFS, SIQS, and ECM).
